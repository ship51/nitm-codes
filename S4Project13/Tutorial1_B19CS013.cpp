// Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, and
// seconds. One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it
// to fixed values. Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format. The final
// member function should add two objects of type time passed as arguments.

// A main() program should create two initialized time objects (should they be const?) and
// one that isnâ€™t initialized. Then it should add the two initialized values together, leaving the
// result in the third time variable. Finally it should display the value of this third variable.
// Make appropriate member functions const.
